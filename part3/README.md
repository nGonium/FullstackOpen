# Phonebook

This is the phonebook application for part 3 of the FullStackOpen course. The online deployment can be found at https://ngonium-phonebook-part3.fly.dev/

This folder contains two project folders. The frontend is located in *phonebook*, the backend in *phonebook_backend*. The app can be viewed via the online link above, or run locally with `npm run dev` from *phonebook_backend*. Similarly the front end can be run seperately with `npm start` if the backend is already running. Running locally requires dependencies are installed (`npm install`). Note that both versions use the backend database, not the *db.json* file in *phonebook*: that is only a leftover from the exercises on FullStackOpen
